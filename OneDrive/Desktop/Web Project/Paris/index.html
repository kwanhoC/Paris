        <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
        <p>I was luchy enough to spend three day visiting Paris this month! I went with a<br>
           friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
        <h4 id"day 1">Day 1</h4>
        <p>On our first day, we started by visiting
           <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was<br>
           the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful
           picture!) We ate dinner at a cute littl bistro<br>
           overlooking <em>La Seine</em></p>

        <h4 id"day 2">Day 2</h4>
        <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenur des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single<br>
           person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion<br>
           <br>
           After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre<br>
           Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city<br>
           had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>Le Louvre</em></p>

        <h4 id"day 3">Day 3</h4>
        <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le<br>
          Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in personwas<br>
          completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many<br>
          sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
